# WSL
# Text file information reader 
This program will display the following information about a given text file:
-File size
-Number of characters
-Creation date 
-Last modification date
To achieve this, we will first need to import the following libraries:
-os
-time
-path
We also need to get the path of a file. To do this, we can use the "realpath (filename)" command.
Then, we will need to get the file siz,e number of characters, and creation/modification dates. For this, we will use the libraries we have imported.
