# WSL
# Text file information reader 
This program will display the following information about a given text file:
<p><em>-File size</em></p>
<p><em>-Number of characters</em></p>
<p><em>-Creation date</em></p> 
<p><em>-Last modification date</em></p>
<br>
<p><strong>To achieve this, we will need to do the following steps</strong></p>
<p><em>-Implement reading parameters from the command line - we need to read filepath</em></p>
<p><em>-Load the file corresponding to the filepath</p>
<p>-Read file metadata - we need the file creation date, file modification date, the file size</em></p>
<p><em>-Read file contents - number of characters, maybe we could read the amount of words in the future as well</em></p>
