# WSL
# Text file information reader 
This program will display the following information about a given text file:
-File size
-Number of characters
-Creation date 
-Last modification date
To achieve this, we will need to do the following steps:
-Implement reading parameters from the command line - we need to read filepath
-Load the file corresponding to the filepath
-Read file metadata - we need the file creation date, file modification date, the file size
-Read file contents - number of characters, maybe we could read the amount of words in the future as well
