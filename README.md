## Text File Information Reader

This program will display the following information about a given text file:

- [ ] File size
- [ ] Number of characters
- [ ] Creation date
- [ ] Last modification date

**To achieve this, we will need to do the following steps:**

- Implement reading parameters from the command line - we need to read the filepath.
- Read file metadata - we need the file creation date, file modification date, and file size.
- Read file contents - number of characters (maybe we could read the number of words in the future as well).
