# WSL
# Text file information reader 
This program will display the following information about a given text file:
 * [ ] File size
 * [ ] Number of characters
 * [ ] Creation date 
 * [ ] Last modification date
<br>
<strong>To achieve this, we will need to do the following steps</strong>
 * Implement reading parameters from the command line - we need to read filepath
 * Read file metadata - we need the file creation date, file modification date, the file size
 * Read file contents - number of characters, maybe we could read the amount of words in the future as well
